Welcome to the Redux Color Schemes extension!  Thank you for your support and purchase.

Online instructions for installing extensions may be found here:  http://docs.reduxframework.com/core/advanced/loading-extensions

Included in the /example directory is a working example for the color schemes extension.  It's designed for, and requires the Wordpress Twenty-Thirteen theme be install and activated.  If you do not have this theme installed, you may download it here: https://wordpress.org/themes/twentythirteen

Once the Twenty-Thirteen theme is active, cut and paste the code from the section_code.txt file in the /example folder into the setSections() function located in your redux options config PHP file and save changes.

Refresh the Redux options panel.

Click the 'Color Schemes' tab in the options panel.

Experiment to your heart's delight.  Any saved changes will be reflected on the front end of the Twenty-Thirteen theme.
