## Welcome to the Redux 4.0 Private Beta

PLEASE DO NOT PUSH CODE DIRECTLY TO THIS REPO!  Please send pull requests only.  Due to the complexity of Redux Framework, we prefer to vet new code and changes for backward compatibility and other potential incompatibilities.  Code pushed directly to this repo will be undone.

PLEASE do not post code anywhere and post any and all issues in THIS issue tracker. By doing this we can quickly resolve any concerns and get Redux 4.0 out!

PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE OUR FORMATTING!!!  While we recognize developers have their own style, we prefer ours.  Thanks

Thank you for respecting this guidelines.  

If you want to interact with us directly, you can join our slack on http://slack.redux.io.

Thank you!
